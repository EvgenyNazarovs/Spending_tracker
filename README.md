# Spending_tracker

An easy-to-use app that allows users to enter transactions, add tags and merchants, and break down their spending by month, tag, or merchant.

# Getting Started

This is app runs on your local server, from your terminal. You must have Ruby, Sinatra, and PSQL installed on your computer.

First, create a database on your machine called spending tracker. Create tables using db/spending_tracker.sql.

Second, navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal and type in 

ruby app.rb

This should start the server. You can now access the app by loading http://localhost:4567/

# Running the Tests

Run ruby db/seeds.rb in your terminal. It will populate the database with some test data and open up the pry environment in the terminal which can be used to test any methods.
